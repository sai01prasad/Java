        <p>Generally, when we make any change in our code, to see those changes on the browser we need to manually refresh the page to see the changes happening. Here the live server extension comes into the picture. After it has been installed, an automated localhost will be able to run in your browser, which you can start with a single button. Once you make changes in your code or write something new, after saving it, the browser will auto-refresh itself, then you will be able to see the changes quickly and automatically. The live server enables you to open an HTML document, and it runs a server for you and opens a browser window with the file in it.Summer-time is here and so is the time to skill-up! More than 5,000 learners have now completed their journey from basics of DSA to advanced level development programs such as Full-Stack, Backend Development, Data Science.</p>
